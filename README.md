# SpaceStation
Follow the instructions on the ```iss.pdf```.  

Note that when you get to Step 2 you will need to add screen.mainloop() to the very end of the file so the map will remain open until the user closes it. 

There are several differences in the files in the project structure compared to the files that the ```iss.pdf``` tells you to reference.  Look at the file structure to find the differences, then alter your program to work with the files in your project.

The map will be larger than the window that your program opens, adjust its size to fix that issue.

When you add the Space Station to the map, you will likely get an error. Discuss how to fix that error with your partner, then fix it.
